    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 15, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of CatalogGuard, operated by Go Above The Line Limited ("we", "us", "our"), a company registered in New Zealand. By purchasing or using CatalogGuard, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    
    <p>CatalogGuard is a software tool that connects your Shopify store and Meta advertising account to help you analyze product-level advertising performance. The service provides directional insights to help identify potential underperforming products in your catalog advertising campaigns.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> CatalogGuard provides directional data, not exact attribution. Meta does not provide product-level conversion data for catalog campaigns. Our tool compares your ad spend data against your Shopify sales data to help identify products that may be underperforming. Results should be used as one input into your advertising decisions, not as definitive performance metrics.</p>

    <h2>2. Account and Access</h2>
    
    <p>To use CatalogGuard, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction</li>
      <li>Have a valid Shopify store and Meta advertising account</li>
      <li>Have authority to connect those accounts to third-party services</li>
      <li>Provide accurate information during registration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and connected services.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment and Pricing</h2>
    
    <p>CatalogGuard is sold as a one-time purchase. Payment is processed by Lemon Squeezy, our merchant of record, who handles all billing, taxes, and payment processing.</p>
    <p>Prices are displayed in USD and may be subject to applicable taxes based on your location. Lemon Squeezy will calculate and collect any required taxes at checkout.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change pricing for future purchases, but your purchase price is locked at the time of payment.</p>

    <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We offer a 14-day refund policy. If CatalogGuard does not work for your setup or you are not satisfied with the product, contact us within 14 days of purchase for a full refund.</p>
    <p>To request a refund, email us at support@catalogguard.com with your order details.</p>

    <h2>5. License and Usage</h2>
    
    <p>Upon purchase, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use CatalogGuard for your own business purposes. You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resell, redistribute, or share access to the service</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code</li>
      <li>Use the service for any illegal purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent any access restrictions or security measures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>Your use of CatalogGuard is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the service, you consent to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our access to your Shopify product, inventory, and order data (read-only)</li>
      <li>Our access to your Meta advertising spend data (read-only)</li>
      <li>Storage and processing of this data to provide the service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We never modify your Shopify store or Meta advertising account. You can revoke access at any time by disconnecting your accounts.</p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
    
    <p>We strive to provide reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. The service depends on third-party APIs (Shopify, Meta) which are outside our control.</p>
    <p>We may occasionally update, modify, or discontinue features with reasonable notice. We will provide at least 30 days notice before discontinuing the core service.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    
    <p>CatalogGuard is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The service will meet your specific requirements</li>
      <li>The service will be uninterrupted or error-free</li>
      <li>The results will be accurate or reliable for your specific situation</li>
      <li>Any particular business outcome will be achieved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The insights provided are directional and should be used alongside your own business judgment. We do not guarantee any specific advertising results or cost savings.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Go Above The Line Limited shall not be liable for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
      <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities</li>
      <li>Advertising decisions made based on the service's insights</li>
      <li>Any damages resulting from third-party service interruptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the service.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Go Above The Line Limited from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting a notice on our website or sending you an email. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of New Zealand. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of New Zealand, unless otherwise required by applicable consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>13. Severability</h2>
    
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>14. Entire Agreement</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Go Above The Line Limited regarding CatalogGuard.</p>
